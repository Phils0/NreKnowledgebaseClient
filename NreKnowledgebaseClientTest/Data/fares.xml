    <ChangesToTravelPlans><![CDATA[Changes to time or date of travel must be arranged before departure of
the first reserved train printed on the ticket, after which the ticket
has no value and a new one must be purchased. Customers will need to
present the ticket(s) and reservation(s) when they request a change.<br />

<p>The difference between the price paid and
cost of the next suitable fare for the journey is payable, plus a £10
administration fee per person, per single ticket for each change to a
journey. If customers change to a train on which a cheaper fare is
available, the difference will not be refunded.</p>
<p>Please note that where an Advance ticket has
been purchased online and the ticket has either been self-printed at

changing the ticket. The relevant conditions will be made clear when the
ticket is bought.</p>]]></ChangesToTravelPlans>
    <Refunds><![CDATA[<p>Advance tickets are non-refundable.</p>
<p>Where an excess fare has been paid up to the
price of a walk-up ticket, the excess fare paid varies the terms under
which the passenger can travel, but it does not alter the refund terms
of the original Advance ticket. If the passenger subsequently asks for a
refund on the combination of Advance ticket plus Excess Fare plus £10
fee, the Advance ticket and £10 fee remain non-refundable and a refund
is only payable on the excess fare paid, less a £10 refund fee.</p>
<p>If the train the customer purchased a ticket
for is cancelled or delayed by more than 60 minutes, special
arrangements will be made to accommodate them on another train (although

<p>Where an excess fare has been paid up to the

which the passenger can travel, but it does not alter the refund terms
of the original Advance ticket. If the passenger subsequently asks for a
refund on the combination of Advance ticket plus Excess Fare plus £10
fee, the Advance ticket and £10 fee remain non-refundable and a refund
is only payable on the excess fare paid, less a £10 refund fee.</p>
<p>If the train the customer purchased a ticket
for is cancelled or delayed by more than 60 minutes, special
arrangements will be made to accommodate them on another train (although
a seat cannot be guaranteed). If the train the customer purchased a
ticket for is cancelled or delayed and as a result, customers decide not
to travel, a refund will be offered on completely unused tickets and
they will not be charged an administration fee.</p>

        you paid and the cost of a ticket or tickets for the period for which
        you have actually used the ticket, plus an administration charge (see
        admin charges below). Because of the discounts on longer term Season
        Tickets, refunds are not made pro-rata to the periods before/after
        surrender and Annual Season Tickets have no refund value after about 10
        1/2 months. For this reason it is recommend that employers' Annual
        Season Ticket loan schemes are set up so that reimbursements are made in
        10 equal monthly payments with two 'free' months at the end of the
        year, rather than in 12 equal monthly payments.</p>
        <p>There must be at least seven days remaining
        on a Monthly Season Ticket or at least three days remaining on a 7 Day
        Season Ticket to obtain a refund (although on some 7 Day Season Tickets
        there may be no refund value after three days of use, dependent upon the
        relevant Standard Day Return price.</p>
        <p>In cases of illness, the refund can be
        backdated if you produce suitable documentary evidence for a period
        before you hand in your ticket, provided that you have not started
        travelling again using your Season Ticket since your illness.</p>
        <p>Refunds or extensions to periods of validity
        are not given for cases of periods of non-use, for example holidays.
        Refunds on duplicate Season Tickets are not normally given although
        consideration will be given if you can supply written evidence of
        redundancy, prolonged illness or similar circumstances or if the
        original ticket is recovered and returned to the issuing ticket office
        within one month of its loss. Please ask at the ticket office for more
        details.</p>]]></Refunds>

    <Refunds><![CDATA[<p>If you stop travelling and no longer need your Season Ticket, please
        hand it in at, or post it to, the ticket office where you bought it.</p>
        <p>Any
        refund is calculated from the date the Season Ticket was handed in. It
        will be the difference between the price you paid and the cost of a
        ticket or tickets for the period for which you have actually used the
        ticket, plus an administration charge (see admin charges below). Because
        of the discounts on longer term Season Tickets, refunds are not made
        pro-rata to the periods before/after surrender and Annual Season Tickets
        have no refund value after about 10 1/2 months. For this reason it is
        recommend that employers' Annual Season Ticket loan schemes are set up
        so that reimbursements are made in 10 equal monthly payments with two
        'free' months at the end of the year, rather than in 12 equal monthly
        payments.</p>
        <p>There must be at least seven days remaining on a Monthly
        Season Ticket or at least three days remaining on a 7 Day Season Ticket
        to obtain a refund (although on some 7 Day Season Tickets there may be
        no refund value after three days of use, dependent upon the relevant
        Standard Day Return price.</p>
        <p>In cases of illness, the refund can be
        backdated if you produce suitable documentary evidence for a period
        before you hand in your ticket, provided that you have not started
        travelling again using your Season Ticket since your illness.</p>
        <p>Refunds or extensions to periods of validity are not given for cases of periods
        of non-use, for example holidays. Refunds on
        duplicate Season Tickets are not normally given although consideration will be given if you can supply written evidence of redundancy, prolonged illness or similar
        circumstances or if the original ticket is recovered and returned to the
        issuing ticket office within one month of its loss. Please ask at the
        ticket office for more details.</p>]]></Refunds>

    <Refunds><![CDATA[<p>Advance tickets are non-refundable, except under the terms of the National Rail Conditions of Travel.</p>
<p>Where an excess fare has been paid up to the price of a walk-up ticket, the excess fare paid varies the terms under which the passenger can travel, but it does not alter the refund terms of the original Advance ticket. If the passenger subsequently asks for a refund on the combination of Advance ticket plus Excess Fare plus £10 fee, the Advance ticket and £10 fee remain non-refundable and a refund is only payable on the excess fare paid, less a £10 refund fee.</p>
<p>If the train the customer purchased a ticket for is cancelled or delayed by more than 60 minutes, special arrangements will be made to accommodate them on another train (although a seat cannot be guaranteed). If the train the customer purchased a ticket for is cancelled or delayed and as a result, customers decide not to travel, a refund will be offered on completely unused tickets and they will not be charged an administration fee.</p>
<p>There may be rare occasions where a cheaper Advance fare becomes available closer to the time of travel, for example if a group booking is cancelled and extra seats become available. Please note that in these circumstances Advance tickets that have already been bought cannot be refunded in part or in full.</p>]]></Refunds>

    <Refunds><![CDATA[<p>Advance tickets are non-refundable, except under the terms of the National Rail Conditions of Travel.</p>
<p>Where an excess fare has been paid up to the price of a walk-up ticket, the excess fare paid varies the terms under which the passenger can travel, but it does not alter the refund terms of the original Advance ticket. If the passenger subsequently asks for a refund on the combination of Advance ticket plus Excess Fare plus £10 fee, the Advance ticket and £10 fee remain non-refundable and a refund is only payable on the excess fare paid, less a £10 refund fee.</p>
<p>If the train the customer purchased a ticket for is cancelled or delayed by more than 60 minutes, special arrangements will be made to accommodate them on another train (although a seat cannot be guaranteed). If the train the customer purchased a ticket for is cancelled or delayed and as a result, customers decide not to travel, a refund will be offered on completely unused tickets and they will not be charged an administration fee.</p>
<p>There may be rare occasions where a cheaper Advance fare becomes available closer to the time of travel, for example if a group booking is cancelled and extra seats become available. Please note that in these circumstances Advance tickets that have already been bought cannot be refunded in part or in full.</p>

days of the week or on a specific route. Website journey planners can
tell you when your ticket can be used - simply enter your outward and
return journey times to see the trains you can travel on. If you board a
train at a time when your Off-Peak ticket is not valid, you will be
charged the difference between the fare you have paid and the cheapest
valid fare for the service concerned.  In some circumstances you may
have to pay a penalty fare.  </p>
<p>If the route shown on the ticket has a + or †

London Stations (e.g. between Liverpool Street and Paddington) by either

assist someone onto the train or if they are a railway enthusiast - they
may need to buy a Platform Ticket, depending on the discretion of staff. </p>
<p class="normal">Not all train companies still issue Platform Tickets but where they are still sold they cost ten pence (10p)
and can only be purchased from the station ticket office. There is no charge to assist a disabled

barriers, unstaffed stations or at stations managed by certain train
companies a Platform Ticket may not be required and customers are
advised to check with the ticket office, where possible, before entering

If the passenger subsequently asks for a refund on the combination of Advance ticket plus Excess Fare plus £10 fee, the Advance ticket and £10 fee remain non-refundable and a refund is only payable on the excess fare paid, less a £10 refund fee.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If the train the customer purchased a ticket for is cancelled or delayed by more than 60 minutes, special arrangements will be made to accommodate them on another train (although a seat cannot be guaranteed). If the train the customer purchased a ticket for is cancelled or delayed and as a result, customers decide not to travel, a refund will be offered on completely unused tickets and they will not be charged an administration fee.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There may be rare occasions where a cheaper Advance fare becomes available closer to the time of travel, for example if a group booking is cancelled and extra seats become available. Please note that in these circumstances Advance tickets that have already been bought cannot be refunded in part or in full.</p>]]></Refunds>
